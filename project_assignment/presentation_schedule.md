# Project presentations

I have received confirmation of group membership from most of you; for the
remaining students I assume that you have remained in the original random
groups I assigned.

Three of the groups should present on Tuesday (26-10) and the remaining three
should present on Friday (29-10). Your presentations should be approximately
15 minutes long with 15 minutes discussion time following. As a general
guide-line for presentation usually suggest to have no more than one slide per minute of
presentation time; in your case I suspect that you will not want
much more than one slide per two minutes, but it is up to you to work out the
best way to present your ideas.


The presentation is mandatory for the course though it is not graded. For this
reason, all group members should be present even if they are not going to be
the one doing the presentation. I will try to direct questions to all group
members after the presentation, so please come prepared.

I am aware that some of you may have difficulty in attending on both days and
you are allowed to swap presentation times with each other as long as there is
agreement from all group members. If you still have difficulty with the
schedule then let me know and I will try to arrange something to compensate.

I am of course aware of the fact that everyone prefers to have the
presentation on the Friday. But, remember that if you have it on Monday you
will have feedback on your ideas earlier and will have more time after this to
work on your projects.
